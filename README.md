## What is Code-Refactor?

Code-Refactor is an SEO best practice of making a website and making the code look clean.

In order to succeed, I have to fix all the 'div' tags and replace them with logical tags without breaking the website.

Additionally, the links have to function and be able to work as it needs to be.
